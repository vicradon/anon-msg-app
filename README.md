## About AnonMsg🙈
AnonMsg is a fun and interactive social media platform that allows users to share links to ask their friends, family, and followers to send anonymous messages, and to ask questions about them in order to learn what people think of them and beyond, having fun and indepth conversations.

Users can quickly share their link and begin reading messags as they get responses.

In order for users' connections and followers to participate in anonymous messaging, AnonMsg makes it incredibly simple for users to post their link on other social networking sites as well.
